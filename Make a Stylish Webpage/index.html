      <div class='description'>
        My name is Antonios Marios Christonasis and hold an Integrated Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Patras in Greece.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I am pursuing a Professional Doctorate in Engineering (<a href="https://www.jads.nl/pdeng-post-master-data-science.html" target="_blank">PDEng</a>) in Data Science at the Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e) in The Netherlands.
        <br><br>
        In the first year of the PDEng program, trainees conduct numerous case studies in teams of 2-4 for companies of the Dutch industry.
        <br><br>
        The projects are meant to practice technical, as well as professional skills for the trainees.
        <br><br>
        In this page, I would like to share the projects in which I have taken part in the PDEng program. <br><br>Hope you find them interesting. :)

        <h2>Conditioned Based Recoiling</h2>
        <p>
          Case Study conducted for the company DOW as part of the 6th Data Challenge Week (DCW) of the PDEng program. The focus was on smart recoiling of furnaces based on data.
          Techniques used: Data Pre-Processing, Data Visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
        </p>

        <h2>Product Classification Based on Sales Profile</h2>
        <p>
          Case Study conducted for the company Saint Gobain. The aim of the project was the classification of products sold by the company based on their sales profile, in order to drive business decisions.
          Techniques that were used are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means Clustering, and Visualization.

        <h2>Management of Building Permits at Dutch Municipalities</h2>
        <p>
          This Case Study was conducted as part of the Process Mining Module of the PDEng program. The dataset was provided by the instructor of the module.
          Process Mining techniques were used to explore the application procedure for building permits in Dutch Municipalities.

        <h2>Enhancing the Management of Buildings through Visualization of Sensor Data</h2>
        <p>
          Case Study that was conducted as part of the Data Visualization Module of the PDEng program. The interested party was the construction company Heijmans and more
          specifically their building Nationaal Militaire Museum. We created a dashboard using Javascript (p5.js, plotly.js) to visualize the time series sensor data that the museum gathers.
          The main focus was on the flow of visitors in the museum.

        <h2>Leakage Detection and Prediction using Pressure Sensor Data</h2>
        <p>
          Case Study that was conducted as part of the 7th Data Challenge Week of the PDEng program for the Brabant Water company. The goal was to detect and possibly predict leakages
          in the water supply system in the Brabant region in The Netherlands based on pressure sensor measurements. Techniques and technologies: Anomaly Detection,
          Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Facebook Prophet), Data Visualization.
        </p>

      <div class='projects'>
        <h2>Walking Behavior of Turkeys based on IMU Sensor Data: a Feature Extraction Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          Case Study conducted as part of the Modelling and Simulation Module of the PDEng program for the company Hendrix Genetics. We analyzed Accelerometer Signals coming from
          Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) located on turkeys. The focus was on the analysis of their walking behavior. Techniques that were utilized: Data Pre-Processing,
          Fast Fourier Transform, Time Series Analysis, Singular Spectrum Transformation, Zero-Velocity Detection for Displacement Calculation. Programming Languages: MatLab, Python.

        <h2>Towards Gas Free Neighborhoods in The Netherlands</h2>
        <!-- <p> -->
          Case Study conducted as part of the Data Engineering Module of the PDEng program. We addressed the energy transition in The Netherlands through three approaches.
          <ul>
            <li>The creation of a Neighborhood Similarity Dashboard</li>
            <li>The creation of a Twitter Sentiment Analysis Pipeline</li>
            <li>The creation of a solar potential dashboard</li>
          </ul>
            Technologies and Techniques used: Apache Kafka, Plotly-Dash, HTML-CSS-Javascript, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sentiment Analysis,
            Spectral Clustering, Segmentation, and Classification, among others.
